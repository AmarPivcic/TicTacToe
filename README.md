# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe app is a fun and classic game that you can play on your Android device or online. It's a two-player game where one player is 'X' and the other is 'O.' The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

To play, each player takes turns clicking on an empty square on the grid to place their symbol. The game continues until one player gets three in a row or all the squares are filled, resulting in a draw. The app will display a message when someone wins.

This game was made to be transformed into an .apk file for Android devices, but you can play it on your browser on any device.
Transformation was done with Appilix website to app converter (https://appilix.com).

## How to use

- Click or tap on the box in the grid where you want to place your symbol
- Click on the "Clear" button to clear the grid. You can do this during the play or after the play has finished.
- Click on the "Reset" button to clear the grid and reset the scoreboard.
