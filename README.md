# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game that you can play online, featuring both Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Bot (PvBot) modes. It's a two-player classic game where one player is 'X' and the other is 'O.' The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In **PvP mode**, two players take turns placing their symbols on the grid.  
In **PvBot mode**, you compete against an intelligent AI agent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, providing a challenging experience.

The app includes a clean interface and smooth gameplay, making it enjoyable on any device with a modern web browser.

## How to Use

- At the start of the game, choose between **PvP** and **PvBot** mode.
- Once a mode is selected, the game board and controls will appear.
- Click or tap on a box in the grid to place your symbol.
  - In **PvP mode**, players take turns manually.
  - In **PvBot mode**, you play as 'X' while the AI plays as 'O.' The bot's move is slightly delayed for a more realistic experience.
- Click the **Clear** button to reset the grid during or after a game.
- Click the **Reset** button to clear the grid and reset the scoreboard.
